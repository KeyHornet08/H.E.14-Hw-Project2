        <p1>  This interactive webpage was created to help the viewer learn about important Japanese prints while giving them a fortune that does not relate to the image itself. This is done purposefully to make the viewer think about how their given fortune would relate to the image being shown. The viewer is also given the historical context behind the image to try and understand how the fortune truly contexts the print, while the fortune doesn't.  All of these prints relate to a culturally significant period in Japan and in the world. Which gives contrast to a fortune that the viewer tries to relate to the drawing. My idea for approaching the work was how I wanted to capture the audience's attention while teaching them about the information gathered in the data. That’s where the idea of mixing fortunes and drawings came from. How I could accomplish this by forcing the viewer to think when looking at the drawing and then looking at the fortune. I believe this method of approach led to my success in making the viewer appreciate the drawing while looking for a reason they were given said fortune. To me this work shows how humans try to find an answer to everything when some things may not have an answer, it’s a way to show how we humans are given an image and text right afterward about something else and try to connect one another to each other. </p1>
